                I have already worked out two methods of trying to work around it, by either having a negative text-indent or using left
                padding to adjust the input and select boxes to match up. Both of these methods aren't perfect. There is
                a difference between the negative text-indent for Chrome and Firefox resulting in a noticeable space if the
                select and input are lined up one after the other. Trying to offset the padding can make maintaining the
                styling of various input and select fields somewhat difficult where you are applying a percentage of padding.
                I first noticed it on a client's website where part of the word was being cut off however if that empty space
                was not there, the word looks like it would fit.
